# KEYNOX
**Keynox** was created to provide a **secure** and **easy-to-use** solution for managing passwords. I built **Keynox** as a personal project to strengthen my skills in **cryptography** and **secure coding practices**, and to provide a useful tool for others who value **simplicity** and **security**.

## We're on this journey together
We care about your experience and hope you're enjoying your new vault.
